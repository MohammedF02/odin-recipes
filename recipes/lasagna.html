    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a
            Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir
            in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and
            water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil,
            1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and
            pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
            occasionally.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
            minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a
            mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining
            2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the
            bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
            lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the
            ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella
            cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over
            mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and
            Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
            either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil
            does not touch the cheese.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the
            foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
            Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful!
        I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on
        flavor to save a few calories.

        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        </li>

        <li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
            the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>

        <li>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3
            minutes before serving.</li>
